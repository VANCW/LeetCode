AVL tree is BST
balanced tree


review: operation of BST
search deletion insertion
all takes O(height_of_the_tree)

skew tree??

adelson_velskii_landis tree 1962
[definition] height balanced of a binary tree
1.

[definition] BF
BF = hl-hr

[question] how to rearrange the tree to be balanced?
  1. RR rotation & LL rotation 
  notice that before trouble maker appears, the BST is supposed to be an height-balanced tree.
  
  2.LR   & RL
   why it is called LR or RL? root from trouble finder->trouble maker
      what is the maximum of the depth difference between trouble finder and trouble maker?
   two situations of LR
    (where to put the trouble maker?)
    (what is the distance between trouble maker and trouble finder?)
   why it is called double rotation?(try yourself)
   
   ways to keep AVL tree:
   1. using BF
   2. keep a height field
   
  try to prove h = O(ln n)
      consider h be the greatest->fix h,n_h be the smallest number of nodes given height h.
      we have n_h = n_h-1 + n_h-2 + 1.(n_0=0,n_1=1,n_2=2)
      it quite resembles fibonacci numbers.
      using MI, we have n_h = F_h+2 - 1 (pls refer to DM)
      since we know F_i is an exponantial expression on i, we get h = O(ln n)
      
      identify these terms(in BST):
      1. tree height
      2. operations(deletion,insertion) all linked with tree height but not number of nodes, O(T_height)
      3. AVL trees ensures h = O(log n),thus make tree operation O(log n)
  
  
  Splay trees
  1. target
    make M conseutive tree operation from an empty tree to be O(MlogN)
    what does amortized time means?
    
    is AVL tree splay tree?why?
    
  does single rotation works for every node visited? what's the worst case?
  
  how to use double rotation?
  X P G
  if P is the root->simple
  1. zig-zag situation
  2. zig-zig situation
  all cause double rotation
  
  pls practice single rotation
  
  deletions on splay trees
    
  Amortized analysis
  amortized bound does not involve probability
  what's the difference between amortized bound and average case-bound?
  
  aggregate analysis
  accounting method
    credit = amortized cost - actual cost
